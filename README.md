# movie-app

**Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is my pet project - movie-app. In this application, I utilize React, React-Query, and Axios.**

## Overview

This project serves as a platform to explore and showcase my skills in building a React application while integrating popular libraries such as React-Query and Axios. The primary focus is on creating a movie-related application that fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## Features

- **React**: The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React-Query**: Utilizing React-Query for efficient and effective data fetching and state management.

- **Axios**: Employing Axios for making HTTP requests to interact with The Movie Database API.

## The Movie Database API

The application relies on data from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). Please refer to the official documentation for more details on the API.

## Features in the App

- **View Details**: Explore detailed information about movies or TV shows.

- **Watch Trailer**: Enjoy a sneak peek by watching the trailer directly within the application.

- **Rating**: Check the ratings to get an idea of the community's opinion on a particular movie or TV show.

## Future Plans

In future iterations of this project, I plan to migrate the codebase to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and a better developer experience.
