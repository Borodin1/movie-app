# movie-app

**Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is my pet project - movie-app. In this application, I utilize React, React-Query, Axios, and TypeScript. I've also incorporated react-spinners for a smoother loading experience.**

## Overview

This project serves as a platform to explore and showcase my skills in building a React application while integrating popular libraries such as React-Query and Axios. The recent addition of TypeScript enhances type safety and developer experience, and the inclusion of react-spinners contributes to a more polished loading interface.

## Features

- **React**: The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React-Query**: Utilizing React-Query for efficient and effective data fetching and state management.

- **Axios**: Employing Axios for making HTTP requests to interact with The Movie Database API.

- **TypeScript**: The codebase has been migrated to TypeScript for enhanced type safety.

- **React-Spinners**: Added react-spinners to enhance the loading experience in the application.

## The Movie Database API

The application relies on data from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). Please refer to the official documentation for more details on the API.

## Features in the App

- **View Details**: Explore detailed information about movies or TV shows.

- **Watch Trailer**: Enjoy a sneak peek by watching the trailer directly within the application.

- **Rating**: Check the ratings to get an idea of the community's opinion on a particular movie or TV show.

In future iterations of this project, I plan to continue refining the application's features and user interface. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
